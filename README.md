## Project name: CIRCOR
# Dataset available on physionet : 'The CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Dataset'

# Objective 1
1. to create a model that is able to detect the presence of heart murmurs based on recordings provided
2. to create an API for the model
3. Put it in production

# Context
1. Project setup
2. Data Exploration
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
4. Model Exploration
5. Model Improvement
6. API creation

# Objective 2
1. to improve our model so that it will be able to pin-point the most possible location of the heart murmurs
2. to incorporate into our API
3. Put it in production
